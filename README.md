This repository contains notes, code, and data for our HILT 2019 workshop,
which runs from 3-7 June on the campus of IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN. Feel
free to use/share/adopt these notes for other courses. 

## Description

Image Analysis with Deep Learning will examine methods for image analysis
at scale. Tasks covered include color analysis, object detection, facial
recognition, image similarity, and image clustering. The course will work
a variety of visual culture including art, photography, and moving images
to ask:

- How can we identify similar works of art using image analysis?
- How can we identify objects in 100,000 photographs?
- How can we track character’s movements in a sit-com?
- How has color in film changed over time?

While the course will introduce several out-of-the-box tools, the main
focus will be on deep learning techniques with Python. No prior programming
experience is required.

## Code of Conduct

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you
make our event a better place.

In order for this tutorial to be successful, we ask that participants take note
of the following guidelines throughout the session:

- This is an interactive workshop, and we expect everyone to, as best as possible,
follow along with the tutorial.
- At the same time, please try not to work ahead in the tutorial. If you are
finished with a section ahead of time, you are more than welcome to hack away at our
code. We find that staying together through the tutorial works best for everyone
involved.
- Hands on your own computer. Unless otherwise noted, please refrain from writing
code on other's computers. You are more than welcome to explain to your neighbors
what is going on in their notebook, but we want everyone to feel comfortable working
with the code themselves.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know!

## Software

We will be using a variety of software in this workshop, all of it is free and
open source. The three main things you will need are:

- [The R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [The RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- [Anaconda Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/)

We will be running deep learning models that are written in Python, but calling
these from within R. The R programming language provides easier to use mechanisms
for interactively plotting data and viewing the results. We will help you set-up
these libraries in the workshop, though please make sure your operating system is
up-to-date (in particular, you will need macOS 10.13 or 10.14 for the libraries
to work properly).
